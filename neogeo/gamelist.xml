		<desc>THIS IS THE THIRD INSTALLMENT IN THE PUZZLE FRENZY SERIES MAGICAL DROP. IN THE GAME YOU CONTROL A CLOWN WHO THROWS MARBLES UP ON THE SCREEN INTO THE CLUSTER OF MULTI-COLORED MARBLES, ROCKS AND CRYSTALS. THE GOAL IS TO GET THREE OR MORE OF THE SAME COLOR TO REMOVE MARBLES, BUT YOU CAN ALSO GRAB MORE THAN ONE AT THE TIME TO CREATE LONG CHAIN COMBOS AND GAIN BETTER "SPECIAL" BLOCKS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME IN SINGLE PLAYER MODES OR VERSUS A FRIEND IN VERSUS MODE. IN VERSUS MODE YOU GET TO PICK YOUR CHARACTER, MUCH LIKE IN A FIGHTING GAME, EACH WITH THEIR OWN COUNTER ATTACKS AND ABILITIES.

FOR THE PSX VERSION, THE FIRST MAGICAL DROP WAS INCLUDED ON A SEPARATE DISC.</desc>

THERE LIVED ONE GRAVEDIGGER AT A VERY SMALL VILLAGE IN A REMOTE REGION. HE LIVED A QUIET, SOLITARY LIFE IN A CORNER OF THE CEMETERY. HE KEPT AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE PEOPLE DUE TO HIS VERY UGLY APPEARANCE. ONE DAY, HE FOUND THE GRAVES WERE RANSACKED AND SOME CORPSES WERE STOLEN. HE DIDN'T WANT THE VILLAGE PEOPLE TO FIND OUT, SO HE DECIDED TO ELIMINATE THE GRAVE BURGLARS BY HIMSELF. THUS, HE PATROLLED THE CEMETERY EVERY NIGHT.

THERE ARE FIVE STAGES WITH FIVE LEVELS EACH, AND EACH ONE OF THEM HAS YOU THROWING FIREBALLS AT GHOULS, GHOSTS, GOBLINS, AND ZOMBIES. WHEN YOU KEEP THROWING FIREBALLS AT THESE ENEMIES, THEY WILL IGNITE INTO A GIANT FIREBALL, WHICH YOU CAN THROW AT OTHER ENEMIES TO KILL THEM, AND GET THE REMAINING TREASURE BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL. AT THE END OF THE FIFTH LEVEL, A BOSS MUST BE DEFEATED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE GAME.</desc>

STARTING FROM THREE IDENTICAL HELMETS LINED UP HORIZONTALLY, VERTICALLY OR DIAGONALLY, THEY EXPLODE AND GENERATE A BOMB IN THE PLAYGROUND. WHEN THEY DISAPPEAR, THEY CAN INITIATE CHAIN REACTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE BLOCKS LYING ABOVE FALLING. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF REMOVED BLOCKS, COMES AN ACTIVATED BOMB: PLAYER HAVE TO PLACE IT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OF THESE BOMBS EXPLODE ON HIS TABLE.</desc>

		<name>REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 - THE NEWCOMERS</name>
		<desc>SNK'S FATAL FURY FIGHTING SERIES REACHES ITS 7TH EPISODE BRINGING A LOT OF "INNOVATIONS" AND SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, STARTING FROM CHARACTERS: ALL THE 20 FIGHTERS FROM PREVIOUS GAME RETURN WITH NEW ARTWORKS AND BATTLE STAGES COMPLETELY REDRAWN, AS WELL AS SOME REMODELED (OR NEW) MOVES.

THE TRADITIONAL FIGHTING SYSTEM COMES WITH SENSIBLE MODIFICATIONS, LIKE THE REMOVAL OF BOTH "RANK SYSTEM" (SSS, SS, S, AAA ETC.) AND GROUND BREAKABLE OBJECTS. THE MATCH SYSTEM USING 2 BATTLE PLANS (FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND) REMAINS SEMI-INTACT, BECAUSE NOW SOME BATTLE FIELDS (LIKE CHENG SINZAN'S STAGE) USES A SINGLE PLANE, FORCING THE PLAYERS TO USE ONLY THE BASIC DEFENSE TO AVOID ATTACKS.

BUT THE MAIN ADDITION OF THIS TITLE (AND THE REASON FOR SUBTITLE "THE NEWCOMERS") ARE 2 NEW CHARACTERS ENTERING FOR FATAL FURY'S MAIN CAST: RICK STROWD, A MYSTERIOUS FIGHTER WITH A PARTICULAR FIGHTING STYLE AND LI XIANGFEI, A YOUNG FEMALE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS FIGHTER.

IN W.G.P MODE, YOU PICK YOUR BIKE THAT YOU WANT TO USE, AND THEN RACE UP TO TEN WORLD CIRCUITS, INCLUDING FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, U.S.A, SPAIN, SWEDEN, AND MORE. YOU RACE AGAINST THE TOP RIDERS. TRY TO AIM FOR THE TOP.

R.P.G. MODE IS INTERACTIVE. YOU TRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS, AND EXPLORE THEM, AND SPEAK TO ANY PEOPLE HERE. YOU START WITH NO BIKE, SO YOU MUST GO TO THE BIKE SHOP AND PURCHASE ONE. THEN WITH SOME HELP WITH THE OWNER, YOU CAN RACE AGAINST UP TO SIX OPPONENTS. THE MORE RACES YOU WIN, THE MORE MONEY YOU EARN. KEEP WINNING AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO RACE THE SUZUKI 8-HOUR. DURING THIS MODE, A TIMER WILL COUNT DOWN. IF THIS EXPIRES, YOU MUST INSERT A COIN IN ORDER TO CONTINUE.

MULTI-PLAY MODE LETS YOU "LINK" CABINETS TOGETHER SO THAT TWO PLAYERS CAN RACE EACH OTHER SIDE-BY-SIDE.</desc>

ON OFFENSE YOU CAN PERFORM SHORT OR LONG PASSES WITH THE A AND C BUTTONS, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE B BUTTON PERFORMS A SCORING KICK. WHILE ON DEFENSE YOU CAN MANUALLY SWITCH PLAYER CONTROL WITH THE B BUTTON OR SLIDE TACKLE THE OPPOSING BALL CARRIER WITH THE A BUTTON.

EACH ACTIVE CHARACTER CAN CHARGE UP "ART OF FIGHTING" STYLE IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO "DESPERATION MOVES", OR "DMS" (MOVES WHICH OPERATE VERY MUCH LIKE STREET FIGHTER'S SUPER COMBOS).

THE KING OF FIGHTERS '95 INTRODUCES KYO KUSANAGI'S RIVAL IORI YAGAMI, AND FIRMLY PLACES KYO AS THE MAIN CHARACTER FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES.

USING THE "TEAM EDIT" FEATURE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE A TOTALLY CUSTOMIZED TEAM USING ANY OF THE AVAILABLE FIGHTERS, OR USE ONE OF THE DEFAULT TEAMS IF YOU WISH.</desc>

IN SPITE OF THESE LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS, THE GAME PRESERVED (AND IMPROVED A LOT) MANY ELEMENTS THAT DID THE PREVIOUS ONE (SAMURAI SHODOWN III: BLADES OF BLOOD) A QUITE POPULAR TITLE, LIKE THE DODGE MOVE AND THE CHANCE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO VERSIONS OF THE FIGHTER: THE STANDARD ONE AND AN ALTERNATIVE DARK-STYLED ONE (SLASH AND BUST, RESPECTIVELY).

WITH THE INTENTION TO PROVIDE MORE ACTION IN THE BATTLES, THE "NO CONTEST" MOVES WERE INTRODUCED: WORKING IN SIMILAR WAY (AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS) TO THE MANY GAMES OF MORTAL KOMBAT SERIES, YOUR FIGHTER WILL EXECUTE AN ULTIMATE-SLAUGHTER MOVE IN A STUNNED OPPONENT.

		<desc>Metal Slug 6 returns to the Rebel-Martian alliance featured in Metal Slugs 2, X, and 3, but on a much broader scale. Rather than repeating the previous games' events of the Martians breaking the alliance and the Rebels assisting the player in turn, the player now teams up with the Rebels and Martians to combat an even greater threat.

Metal Slug 6 introduces a new play mechanic dubbed the 'Weapon Stock System'. Two gun power-ups can now be carried at the same time. Players can switch between the two weapons, or simply put them both away in favor of the default weapon. When obtaining a new weapon power-up, it will automatically occupy the inactive slot, or, if both are holstered, replace the less recent weapon of the two.
The score is now multiplied by powers of 2. The faster the speed at which enemies are killed, the higher the power, as a meter at the bottom of the screen shows. When it says "Max" enemies and destructible objects will drop coins for an extra high score.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo World Soccer '96 is a 2D soccer game. The game has a total of 32 playable teams, each with its own starting formation as well as ratings in three attributes: speed, power, and press. The teams are divided by groups of four into eight world regions: Europe I-IV, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. 

On offense you can perform short or long passes with the A and C buttons, respectively, while the B button performs a scoring kick. While on defense you can manually switch player control with the B button or slide tackle the opposing ball carrier with the A button. Most of the time the game plays like a traditional 2D soccer title, but when the ball carrier and a defending player face off against each other, the game changes into a feinting interface.</desc>

		<desc>IN THE YEAR 2020, BASEBALL FINALLY EVOLVED. THERE IS NO LONGER CONVENTIONAL PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL IN 2020. BASEBALL DESIGNED BY THE SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR AND IS THE BEST SPORT.

HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ASSOCIATION HAS USED A COLOSSAL SUM OF MONEY TO PROMOTE SUPER BASEBALL AS SHOW BUSINESS. THEY HAVE MANIPULATED EACH PLAYER'S ABILITY USING THE CONTROL COMPUTER TO SECRETLY DECIDE VICTORY OR DEFEAT IN EVERY GAME. THE PLAYERS WHO KNEW THIS REMOVED THE CONNECTING PARTS OF THE COMPUTER TO PLAY THEIR OWN GAME OF BASEBALL. FINALLY, A FAIR GAME IS GOING TO BE PLAYED AT CYBER EGG STADIUM.

IN 2020 SUPER BASEBALL IS A FAST-PACED GAME WITH NEW RULES, WHERE YOU CAN SELECT 1 OF 12 INDIVIDUAL MEN, WOMEN, OR ROBOT PLAYERS. DURING PLAY, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR TEAM STRONGER WITH PRIZES EARNED FROM AMAZING CATCHES.

IT PITS 8 FIGHTERS OF DIFFERENT STYLES AND STRENGTHS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A TOURNAMENT TO SEE WHO'S THE TOUGHEST MOFO ON THE STREETS OF TOKYO. YOUR OBJECTIVE AS USUAL IS TO DEPLETE YOUR OPPONENT'S HEALTH BAR WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT BY USING YOUR BASIC ATTACKS AND SPECIAL MOVES (TRIGGERED BY SPECIFIC CONTROLLER MOTIONS) WHILE AVOIDING HIS MOVES AND ATTACKS.

UNIQUE TO AGGRESSORS OF DARK KOMBAT IS THE COMBINATION OF TRADITIONAL SIDE-SCROLLING BEAT 'EM UP ELEMENTS, MEANING CHARACTERS CAN FREELY MOVE IN AN ISOMETRIC SPACE INSTEAD OF BEING RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE PLANE OF MOVEMENT. WEAPONS AND THROW-ABLE ITEMS ARE USUALLY THROWN INTO THE ARENA BY THE CROWDS AND YOU CAN PICK THEM UP AND WIELD THEM FOR ADDED DAMAGE. ADDITIONALLY, MATCHES ARE 1-ROUND ONLY AFFAIRS, WITH AN EXTENDED MULTI-LAYERED HEALTH BAR THAT ALLOWS FOR LONGER ROUNDS THAN USUAL.</desc>

FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH SEVEN STAGES IN THIS HORIZONTAL-SCROLLING GAME, AND DEFEAT A BOSS AT THE END OF EACH ONE. YOU START THE GAME WITH FOUR MAIN WEAPONS, WHICH YOU CAN SWITCH FROM WITH THE CLICK OF A BUTTON. SOME OF THESE WEAPONS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN OTHERS. YOU CAN ALSO FIRE OFF A CHARGED SHOT IF YOUR MAIN WEAPON LEVEL IS TWO OR GREATER, SIMPLY BY HOLDING DOWN THE FIRE BUTTON FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS. USING CHARGED SHOTS CAN DO MORE DAMAGE TO AN ENEMY SHIP. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DIE, YOU WILL LOSE ONE POWER LEVEL FROM ALL FOUR WEAPONS. IF ALL YOUR LIVES ARE LOST AND ARE FORCED TO CONTINUE, YOU WILL START AGAIN WITH YOUR MAIN WEAPON ON THE SECOND POWER LEVEL AND ALL THREE SUB-WEAPONS ON THE FIRST POWER LEVEL.</desc>

KARATE, THE FINAL BOSS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME, BEHIND THE MASK, IS REALLY TAKUMA SAKAZAKI, RYO AND YURI'S FATHER, THAT TAKUMA WAS BEING USED BY GEESE HOWARD FOR HIS OWN EVIL INTENTIONS, AND THAT MR. BIG WAS THE ONE WHO HAD ORIGINALLY KIDNAPPED YURI.

MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EXISTED IN THE FIRST GAME HAVE BEEN FIXED IN THIS INSTALLMENT (IT IS EASIER TO EXECUTE SPECIAL MOVES, YOU NO LONGER HAVE ONLY RYO OR ROBERT TO CHOOSE FROM IN 1 PLAYER MODE, ETC.).

THE ENTIRE CAST FROM THE FIRST ART OF FIGHTING IS HERE (WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF TODO AND MR. KARATE), ALONG WITH A FEW NEW CHARACTERS: TAKUMA SAKAZAKI, RYO AND YURI'S FATHER; YURI SAKAZAKI, TAKUMA'S DAUGHTER AND RYO'S SISTER; EIJI KISARAGI, A SWORN ENEMY OF THE SAKAZAKIS; TEMJIN, A MONGOLIAN TRUCKER; AND A YOUNGER VERSION OF GEESE HOWARD, WHOM YOU FACE AS THE LAST BOSS IF YOU BEAT THE GAME WITHOUT LOSING A ROUND.</desc>

		<name>Choutetsu Brikin'ger - Iron Clad</name>
		<desc>Ironclad is a side scrolling shooter developed by Saurus in 1996. Ironclad was first shown in its native MVS cartridge format at the March 1996 ACME show in Orlando, Florida. I saw and played the game at the show. We always knew therefore that at the very least, one proto was available on the MVS format. Although the game saw release on the NEOGEO CD system, it was never officially released in either the MVS or HOME cartridge formats. Ironclad was the most sought after of all the CD-protos because of its appeal to shoot 'em up fans. This was most likely why it had coincidentally caused the largest number of false claims; more then any other proto cartridge! 13 years later, in November of 2009, SNK finally released the native ROM data for the game and as a result we finally got the game and can now enjoy it forever!</desc>

		<desc>Crossed Swords II is a "Hack 'n Slash" action game released in 1995 by ADK exclusively for the Neo Geo CD. It is the sequel to 1991's Crossed Swords. This version is a bootleg/hack of the CD version to make it playable in the Neo Geo MVS arcade system.

Crossed Swords II features the same gameplay from its predecessor (Crossed Swords on Neo Geo MVS and AES). The player is given a first-person view with a third-person silhouette/wire-frame view of the character similar to the Punch-Out!! arcade game. New to this sequel is the addition of a new button for jumping and dashing, giving the player more maneuverability and allowing him to dodge incoming attacks. By pressing the attack button after dashing the player will make a horizontal slash which stuns enemies briefly, and by pressing the attack button after jumping the player will make a powerful downward slash.

The player can now choose between three characters: the Knight, who is powerful but slow, the Dancer, who is fast but weak, and the Ninja, who has balanced stats. After choosing the character, the player must choose between two game modes: "Nausizz Counterattack" is the main story mode, while "Karividu Arena" is a survival mode where the player fights various enemies consecutively. 

The Story: Decades have passed since the messenger of darkness Nausizz was defeated and peace restored to the kingdom of Belkana. This peace wouldn't last forever, though, as Nausizz's demonic castle has arisen from the depths of hell and his hordes of demons once again threaten the peaceful kingdom with chaos and destruction. Three brave warriors then join together to put and end to Nausizz's reign of terror.</desc>
